<i>Create beautiful block gradients in a few clicks! <a href="https://1280px.github.io/hueblocks">Web version available here</a></i></p>

<b>HueBlocks is an online Minecraft block gradients generator powered by jQuery, Python and cinnamon latte. </b>
<br>It's really simple to use: just enter two colours on a gradient bar and press the Big Black Button. That's it!

Additionally you can:<ul>
<li>use custom chain lenght if you want to get bigger or smaller block gradient
<li>pick starting/final colour from the block you want to start/end with
<li>select a blocks preset (or even create your own!) if you want to generate a gradient using only specific blocks
<li>switch between new and old textures (blocksets) if you're playing on legacy Minecraft versions
<li><b>[ʙᴇᴛᴀ]</b> use your own blocksets if you want to create a gradient out of non-Vanilla blocks
<li><i>etc.</i></ul>

HueBlocks uses Minecraft Java Edition 1.18 (Jappa-nese) and 1.12.2 (Programmer's Art) block textures. 
<br>Please note that <i>not every single</i> texture included! Transparent, some non-solid and generally messy-looking blocks (like TNT) were scrapped for the sake of better gradient generation quality.

If you want to generate custom presets for your fork, you can use blox2rgb.py — a simple Python script for autogeneration blockdata files. <i>Check <a href="https://github.com/1280px/hueblocks/tree/main/data/!!%20blox2rgb">"blox2rgb" folder</a> for more info</i>
