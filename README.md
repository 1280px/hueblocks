<i>Create beautiful blocks gradients in a few clicks! <a href="https://1280px.github.io/p/hueblocks">Web version available here</a></i></p>

HueBlocks is an online Minecraft block gradients generator powered by jQuery, Python and cinnamon latte. 
<br>It's really simple to use: just enter two colours on a gradient bar and press the Big Black Button. Additionally, you can set custom block gradient chain length and configure some other options.

By default it uses default MCJE 1.17 block textures. You can also use your assets â€” just replace the textures in the "input" folder (make sure all the textures you want to use are NOT transparent and have a 1:1 aspect ratio (16x16px, 32x32px etc.)) and run blox2rgb.py

HueBlocks is coded on JS + jQuery 3.6.0, and the blox2rgb script is on Python 3.9 with PILLOW external library used for image editing.
