
blox2rgb.py is a very simple Python script for converting blocksets (a directory with Minecraft textures) to a blockdata (color data of every single block from a blockset) .js file.


==== WHAT DO I NEED TO RUN IT?
here's what you need to run this script:
- Python 3.8 on newer (sorry Windows XP users!)
- PILLOW module (run "pip install pillow" in CMD.EXE)


==== OKAY, SO HOW TO USE IT?
[1] put your blockset's folder to the same directory where blox2rgb is stored
[2] run blox2rgb.py (if it doesn't work, make sure you've installed PILLOW and using at least Python 3.8)
[3] enter the blockset's directory's name in a command prompt and wait...
[4] ...w...a...i...t... (actually it takes less then a second even on my potato PC lol)
[5] PROFIT! if you want to convert another blockset, type it's directory's name, or hit Enter to quit.
