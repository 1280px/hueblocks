<i>Create beautiful block gradients in a few clicks! <a href="https://1280px.github.io/hueblocks">Web version available here</a></i></p>

<b>HueBlocks is an online Minecraft block gradients generator powered by jQuery, Python and cinnamon latte.</b>
<br>It's really simple to use: just enter two colours on a gradient bar, select gradient lenght and press the Big Black Button. That's it!

You can select a blocks preset (<strike>or even create your own!</strike> <b>[Work In Progress]</b>) if you want to generate a gradient using only specific blocks, and select between new (Jappa-nese) and old (Programmer's Art) textures if you prefer playing on legacy Minecraft versions.

It uses MCJE 1.17.1 (Jappa-nese) and MCJE 1.12.2 (Programmer's Art) block textures. 
<br>Please note that <i>not every single</i> texture was included — transparent, some non-solid and generally messy-textured blocks (like Jack o'Lantern) were scrapped for the sake of better gradient generation quality.

If you want to modify the blocksets or use your own presets, you can use blox2rgb.py — a simple Python script for autogeneration blockdata files. Check "blox2rgb" folder for more info
